# sorter-bot
A simple Minecraft bot designed to organize chests based on item categories, powered by Mineflayer.

## Commands
I'll revisit this when its ready to use

## Env variables
- HOST - Where the bot should connect to. Defaults to localhost
- PORT - The port to use. This one will change a lot
- USERNAME - The name the bot will use in-game
- PASSWORD - Only applies to legit accounts and online servers, which is strongly discouraged.

Aren't sure how to use env varables? [This page](https://codeburst.io/process-env-what-it-is-and-why-when-how-to-use-it-effectively-505d0b2831e7) might help.

## How it works
Same as ## Commands
